# ComNet
Implemention of ComNet with Kerasï¼šCombination of Deep Learning and Expert Knowledge in OFDM Receivers


# ComNet-OFDM
Using deep model to implement channel estimation and demodulation based on classcial OFDM receiver. 


# Envs:
Windows


tensorflow:1.8.0


Keras:2.1.6


python:3.6


You can re-train this model on Ubuntu system.


# Get Start
Train:


python main_comnet.py --train_flag True 


Test and Plot:


python main_comnet.py --train_flag False --plot True


# Tips:


Every 128 bits datas are predicted by 8 deep models.The first model predict [0:16] bits,the second model predict [16:32], etc.This code only includes the first model.You can also try to convert the size 16 to other numbers.
